  <score_reason>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary ,should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD : in the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAd : the sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [location] [subject] [verb] [Object] [verb-post]?

    Let's break down the sentence and work through it together.
    Vocabulary Table:
    | Japanese | Romanji	| English
    |          |  kuma	    | bear
    |          | tobira	    | door
    |          | gomi	    | garbage
    |          | suteru	    | to throw away
    |          | deru	    | to go out
    Possible Sentence Structure:
    The sentence seems to be composed of two parts: a statement about bears being at the door, and a question about leaving the garbage out. We can try to structure it like this:
    [Statement about bears] + [Question about garbage]
    For the statement about bears, we might use a sentence structure like: [Subject] + [Location] + [Existential verb]
    For the question about garbage, we might use a sentence structure like: [Object] + [Action verb] + [Question marker]
    Clues:
    For "Bears are at the door", think about using the existential verb "" (imasu) or "" (arimasu) depending on the subject.
    For "did you leave the garbage out?", think about using the verb "" (suteru) in the past tense, and a question marker like "" (ka) or "" (desu ka).

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
